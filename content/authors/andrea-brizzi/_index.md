I am a PhD student at Imperial College London, part of the StatML CDT. My interests lie in the application of Bayesian modelling and phylogenetics for epidemiological applications. My research focuses on the Sub-Saharan African HIV epidmic, where I am to describe time-varying transmission patterns as well as developing methods to estimate infection dates.
